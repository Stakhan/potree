TODO orthographic cameras:

- ortho picking
- ortho zoom to double click
- navigation cube
- (weights for node refinement for large pointclouds)

TODO clipping:

- polygon clipping 
  - vertices are distorted at the boundaries of the render area (caused by perspective projection)
  - picking with ortho cameras (fix ortho camera picking first)
  - EDL renderer: no depth of volumes stored -> no depth test possible
- clip planes
  - EDL renderer: no depth of volumes stored -> no depth test possible
