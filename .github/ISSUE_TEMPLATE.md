Thank you for your interest! In an effort to make it easier to respond to your problem we would like
for you to consider a few things:

- Can you try to phrase it as a task?
    Instead of "What unit is used in the cut view?" ask for "Clarify unit in cut view".

- Can you make a screenshot or a screencast?
    Some graphic errors are hard to describe, a screenshot helps to get your problem accross.
    A service like [Gyazo Gif](https://gyazo.com/download) makes it possible to keep the link up for a long time.
    Please don't link to a url that could be gone in a month or two (like dropbox).  

- Did you reach out on Gitter?
    We have a gitter [channel for potree](https://gitter.im/potree/Lobby). Did you try to ask about your issue there?

Thank you for considering. Please delete this text after you read it.
