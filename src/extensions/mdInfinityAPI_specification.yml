    the mdInfinity Potree API allows you to remotely control a specific version of the Potree pointcloud viewer.
    It is a synchronous API, which means that client and server do play similar roles.
    For clarity, messages sent by the server have been distinguished from those sent by the client. ðŸ˜Ž
